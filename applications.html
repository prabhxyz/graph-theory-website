      <!-- Section 1: Introduction -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-light">
        <h2>Welcome to the Applications!</h2>
        <p>
          Graph theory is used far beyond computer science. 
          As you scroll, you will see how it applies in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, social sciences, and more.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 2: Mathematics -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-secondary text-white">
        <h2>Mathematics</h2>
        <p>
          Graph theory began as a part of mathematics. Mathematicians study graphs to prove theorems about connectivity,
          colorings (like the Four Color Theorem), and cycles. It also plays a big role in combinatorics,
          helping count possible structures and solve complex problems in discrete math.
        </p>
        <p>
          In modern research, mathematicians investigate advanced topics like graph minors, topological graph theory,
          and algebraic graph theory, revealing deeper insights into how networks behave and how they can be characterized.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 3: Physics & Network Science -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-light">
        <h2>Physics &amp; Network Science</h2>
        <p>
          In physics, graphs model large, complex systems such as electrical grids, the power distribution network,
          or even the structure of the internet. Network science grew out of statistical physics, focusing on
          properties like scale-free networks (where some nodes have very high connectivity) or small-world networks
          (where most nodes can be reached within a few steps).
        </p>
        <p>
          Physicists use graph theory to understand how disruptions can cascade, how resilient a network is to failures,
          and how certain patterns emerge naturally in real-world systems. This helps in designing robust infrastructures
          and predicting phenomena like blackouts or traffic jams.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 4: Chemistry -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-secondary text-white">
        <h2>Chemistry</h2>
        <p>
          In chemistry, molecules are naturally viewed as graphs: atoms as nodes and bonds as edges.
          This lets scientists enumerate possible compounds, predict their stability, and see how molecular structure
          affects reactivity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Chemical graph theory also helps in computational chemistry, where software matches substructures
          (like certain ring systems) to identify or design new drugs. These approaches date back to 19th-century work
          by Cayley and Sylvester and continue to be crucial in modern drug discovery.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 5: Biology & Bioinformatics -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-light">
        <h2>Biology &amp; Bioinformatics</h2>
        <p>
          In biology, graphs appear everywhere: protein–protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks,
          neural networks in the brain, and food webs in ecology. Graph theory helps map these relationships
          and identify key nodes (like essential genes or keystone species).
        </p>
        <p>
          In bioinformatics, graph algorithms help assemble genomes (by connecting overlapping DNA reads),
          detect functional modules in protein networks, and model how diseases spread. This interdisciplinary work
          is crucial for medical research, epidemiology, and understanding complex life systems.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 6: Social Sciences -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-secondary text-white">
        <h2>Social Sciences</h2>
        <p>
          Social network analysis (SNA) uses graphs to represent how people or organizations connect. 
          Sociologists, anthropologists, and political scientists map relationships to see who influences whom,
          how information spreads, and how communities form or fragment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graph theory can reveal “hubs” of influence, detect hidden groups, or explain how social norms travel.
          It underpins modern social media analytics, helping us understand phenomena like viral memes
          or political mobilization on platforms like Twitter.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 7: Linguistics & Humanities -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-light">
        <h2>Linguistics &amp; Humanities</h2>
        <p>
          Linguists use graph models to parse syntax (sentence structures) and semantics (word meaning networks).
          This can help build better natural language processing systems that understand grammar or sense relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the humanities, scholars map relationships among historical figures (who corresponded with whom),
          track the spread of artistic movements, or even chart character interactions in literature.
          Graph-based visualizations can reveal hidden patterns in historical or cultural data.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 8: Engineering & Infrastructure -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-secondary text-white">
        <h2>Engineering &amp; Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          Engineers design complex systems like computer networks, transportation routes, and power grids
          using graph theory. Graph algorithms can optimize flow, reduce congestion, or find the most reliable
          routes in a large-scale network.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, city planners use graph-based traffic models to time traffic lights or propose new roads.
          Power companies model grids as graphs to monitor load distribution and quickly isolate faults.
          These methods keep modern infrastructure efficient and resilient.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 9: Economics & Finance -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-light">
        <h2>Economics &amp; Finance</h2>
        <p>
          Economists and financial analysts use graph theory to study trade networks, financial markets,
          and inter-bank lending. These networks can reveal how risk or shocks propagate, helping policymakers
          prevent cascading failures (like the 2008 financial crisis).
        </p>
        <p>
          Graphs also power recommendation systems in e-commerce, analyzing consumer–product links. 
          In finance, fraud detection systems rely on network analysis to spot suspicious transaction patterns.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 10: Healthcare & Epidemiology -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-secondary text-white">
        <h2>Healthcare &amp; Epidemiology</h2>
        <p>
          Healthcare providers use graph models to map patient referrals, track disease outbreaks, and optimize
          hospital workflows. Epidemiologists model contact networks to see how infections spread
          and which interventions (like vaccination or social distancing) could break transmission chains.
        </p>
        <p>
          These approaches proved critical during COVID-19, helping public health officials identify super-spreader
          events and shape policy decisions to reduce community spread.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 11: Cybersecurity -->
      <div class="horizontal-section bg-light">
        <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>
          Graphs help detect and prevent cyber threats by modeling devices, user accounts, and connections.
          Attack graphs map all possible paths a hacker might take, letting security teams patch weaknesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Network analysis also helps identify anomalies in traffic patterns or user behaviors,
          making it easier to spot intrusions, malware, or suspicious activities before they cause harm.
